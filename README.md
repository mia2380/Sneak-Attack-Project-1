## Project Description/User Story: 

GIVEN a user wants to find a movie to watch and where to watch it
WHEN a search for a film is executed on our site
THEN they are presented with a random film by genre and its streaming availability

Our project  allows a user to pick a movie to watch by pulling data from two different APIs. Users are first able to search for a movie by name. If they select a film, it will pull general information, a poster, and the streaming location for the movie. If the user doesn't want know what to watch, they can choose from a number of random movie generators by genre. The site will save randomly generated movies to a Movie Search History. Users can click on a movie in the movie search history to pull up the details from that movie again.
